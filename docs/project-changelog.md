# Project Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Streaming translation UX: panel appears instantly on ⌃⌥T/⌃⌥S with loading state, tokens stream progressively from OpenAI SSE
- `StreamingTranslationState` observable model for reactive panel updates
- `translateStream()` protocol method with default single-shot fallback
- `translateStreaming()` on TranslationService for hotkey/screenshot flows
- Floating panel drag-to-move and edge/corner resize
- `scripts/clean-reset.sh` for quick app data reset (Keychain, UserDefaults, history, DerivedData)

### Changed
- Panel no longer auto-dismisses on outside click — close via X button, Copy, or new translation
- Streaming panel uses fixed 200px height with ScrollView + auto-scroll instead of per-token window resize

### Fixed
- Streaming panel jitter caused by per-token window resize recalculating position
- Panel shrinking/text overflow after stream completion (`fittingSize` returns near-zero for ScrollView)

### Fixed
- ⌃⌥T hotkey always showing "No text selected" — root cause: `CGEventSource(.hidSystemState)` leaked physical ⌃⌥ modifiers into simulated ⌘+C
- Added AX API (`kAXSelectedTextAttribute`) as primary text reader (fast, no clipboard side effects); clipboard simulation kept as fallback with `.privateState`

### Removed
- Claude/Anthropic provider support: removed `.claude` case from `ProviderType` enum, keychain constant, API key settings UI section, and doc comments
- Provider picker from General Settings (only OpenAI remains, picker was redundant)
- Clipboard translate hotkey placeholder (⌃⌥V) — unused after Phase 6 scope change

### Changed
- App now exclusively uses OpenAI (GPT-4o mini) as translation backend
